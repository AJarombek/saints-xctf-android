# saints-xctf-android

The SaintsXCTF Android App goes along with my website SaintsXCTF.com.  This is my first Android app to be released publicly.
All development is done in Java.  The backend calls the REST API built on the website server (Written in PHP).

There is also an iOS app in development.

You can follow development of the website here: [SaintsXCTF Website GitHub](https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf).

You can follow development of the ios app here: [SaintsXCTF iOS GitHub](https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-ios).
